# Iris-flower-Neural-Network
Implementation of the back propagation learning algorithm on the Iris flower dataset.

The implementation is vectorized and dynamic to support any network configuration.

The project contains a training mode in which the user enters the hidden layers then get the accuracy and confusion matrix.

Also the user can enter an input directly to be classified.
